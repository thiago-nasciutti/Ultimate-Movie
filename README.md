# Ultimate Movies


##  The URL of the Deployed Application:

https://thiago-nasciutti.github.io/Ultimate-Movie/


## Project Description:

Our goal is to bring fast, reliable, and trouble-free open-source movies application. As a developer, our group creates a simple movie application that allows the user to select and save movies by rating. So, that user can watch top rating movies with no hustle. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.


## How to Run the Project:

When we go to the movie application it shows instructions to go to on to the next page by clicking the arrows or scrolling down either way. The next page shows a search bar that allows user to input their movie name and the moment user start typing the characters drop-down option start showing multiple movie options to choose from. The title for the searched movie is saved in local storage and when user refreshes the page it shows that local storage maintain the data for the searched movies. When user select a movie it gives detailed data about the movie which isincludes: Title of the movie, Movie Poster, Plot, Year, Director, Genre, Writer, Actors, Awards, Language, and Rating.
